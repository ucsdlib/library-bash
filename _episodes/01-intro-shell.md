## Introduction

In this session we will introduce programming by looking at how data can be manipulated, counted, and mined using the Unix shell, 
a command line interface to your computer and the files to which it has access.

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for the Linux 
operating system and for Unix-like systems (such as iOS). 
For Windows users, popular shells such as Cygwin or Git Bash provide a Unix-like 
interface (a command line interface preferable - to me at least - to Windows own flavour of command line). 
This session will cover a small number of basic commands using Git Bash for Windows users, 
Terminal for iOS. These commands constitute building blocks upon which more 
complex commands can be constructed to fit your data or project.


The motivations for wanting to learn shell commands are many and various. 
What you can quickly learn is how to query lots of data for the information you want super fast. 
Say, for example, you have a query from a reader about the number of articles published in 
2009 in academic history journals whose title contains the word 'International'. 
Now you could search a database. Alternatively you could work directly with the relevant data. 
The British Library has open data on journal articles, and I've prepared from that...

~~~
wc -l 2014-01_JA.tsv
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
507732 2014-01_JA.tsv
~~~
{: .output}

... a 500,000 line data file containing that information. Excel will struggle to manipulate that, 
but the shell won't. Let's look at this shell command:

~~~
grep 2009 2014-01_JA.tsv | grep INTERNATIONAL | awk -F'\t' '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c`

This is simple, powerful, and does what we want. 
It may seem intimidating but, as you'll discover this evening, 
it is deeply logical and eminently within your reach. Let us go through each part in turn:

- `grep 2009 2014-01_JA.tsv` : this tells the machine to look in the spreadsheet 2014-01_JA.tsv for all the lines that contain the string 2009 and to store those in memory. The pipe then tells the machine to hold those in memory for the minute as we have something else we want to do...
- `grep INTERNATIONAL` : ...that is look for the capitalised string `international` on those lines that have 2009 in them. The shell is case sensitive by default and I know that in my data most (if not all) occurrences of international in caps will be in a column that lists journal titles. Note: this isn't super exact, but I know my data and know it'll do the job of now (think back to the automate vs manual discussion last week). Again it holds this subset in memory and...
- `awk -F'\t' '{print $5}'` : ...moves on to the next bit. This is the most fiddly of the bits and not something we will cover properly today. But all it says is that 2014-01_JA.tsv is a tab separated spreadsheet and to print out to the shell the 5th column (which is the one I know contains journal titles) of all the lines we've queried down to (those with 2009 in them, and then those with INTERNATIONAL in them) and to hold that in memory so that we can then...
- `sort` : ...sort that column. `sort` does what is says on the tin, and sorts the data we have left (which should just a single column containing journal titles) holding that sorted list in memory...
- `uniq -c` : ... so that we can then, finally, tell the machine to remove duplicates but as it is doing so count those duplicates and hold that data in memory.

As this is the last bit, the shell then - by default - prints the results to a shell: 
the number of articles published in 2009 in academic journals whose title contains the word 'International', 
with counts separated by journal. This last bit I have added in as, as we can see, 
we have a few false positives. We'd have to go back to our data to find out why, but this is a very good start: 
from 500,000 lines of journal article metadata to a few numbers and names in a small line of code.

You won't be doing exactly this by the end, but you won't be far off. 
We'll be covering quite a lot but the key commands are in the handout for reference.
We'll proceed in a follow my leader fashion. The format will be that I'll demo a command, you copy, 
and then we'll discuss the results. Stickies for when you get stuck or something doesn't appear to work.

## Basics - navigating the shell

We will begin with the basics of navigating the Unix shell.

Start by opening your shell. When you run it, you will likely see a black window with a cursor flashing next to a dollar sign. 
This is our command line, and the `$` is the command **prompt** to show the system is ready for your input.

If, when opening a command window or at any other time today, 
you are unsure of where you are in a computer's file system, 
you can find out what directory you are in using `pwd` command, 
which stands for "print working directory", and hitting enter - which executes commands in the shell. 
Try typing `pwd` and hitting enter.

~~~
pwd
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
/Users/riley
~~~~
{: .output}

To orient ourselves, let's get a listing of what files are in this directory. 
Type `ls` and you will see a list of every file and directory within your current location.

~~~
ls
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~ 
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~
{: .output}

You may want more information than just a list of files. 
You can do this by specifying various **flags** to go with our basic commands. 
These are additions to a command that provide the computer with a bit more guidance 
of what sort of output or manipulation you want.

If you type `ls -l` and hit enter the computer returns a long list of files that contains 
information similar to what you'd find in your finder or explorer: 
the size of the files in bytes, the date it was created or last modified, and the file name.

~~~
ls -l

In everyday usage you will be more used to units of measurement like kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. 
Luckily, there's another flag `-h` that when used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: 
Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the 
number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.

Now `ls -h` won't work on its own. When you want to use two flags, 
you can just run them together. So, by typing `ls -lh` and hitting 
enter you receive an output in a human-readable format (note: that the order here doesn't matter).

ls -lh

You've now spent a great deal of time in your home directory. 
Let's go somewhere else. You can do that through the `cd` or Change Directory command. 

If you type `cd desktop` you are now on your desktop 
(note: for Windows users, the case of the file/directory doesn't matter. 
For Linux users like me, it does, and I believe that is the same for Mac people). 
To double check, type `pwd` and you should see something that represents your desktop.

~~~
cd desktop
~~~
{: .bash}


You'll note that this only takes you 'down' through your directory structure 
(as in into more nested directories). If you want to go back, you can type `cd ..`. 
This moves us 'up' one directory, putting us back where we started. 
If you ever get completely lost, the command `cd --` (or `cd ~` or even just `cd`) will bring 
you right back to the home directory, right where you started.

> ## Switching Back to Previous Directory
>To switch back and forth between two directories use `cd -`.
>{: .callout}

Try exploring: move around the computer, get used to moving in and out of directories, 
see how different file types appear in the Unix shell. 

Being able to navigate your file system using the bash shell is very important for using the Unix shell effectively. 
And as you become more comfortable, you'll soon find yourself skipping directly to the directory that you want.

>## Getting help
>Use the `man` command to invoke the manual page (documentation) for a Shell command. 
>For example, `man ls` displays all the flags/options available to you - which saves 
>you remembering them all! Try this for each command you've learned so far. 
>Use the `spacebar` to navigate the manual pages, and `q` to quit. 
>*Note:* this command is for Mac and Linux users only. It may not work for Windows users.

LS(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    LS(1)

NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-ABCFGHLOPRSTUW@abcdefghiklmnopqrstuwx1] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the names
     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, asso-
     ciated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted sepa-
     rately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     -@      Display extended attribute keys and sizes in long (-l) output.

     -1      (The numeric digit ``one''.)  Force output to be one entry per
             line.  This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

     -A      List all entries except for . and ...  Always set for the super-
             user.

     -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).

     -B      Force printing of non-printable characters (as defined by
             ctype(3) and current locale settings) in file names as \xxx,
             where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.

     -b      As -B, but use C escape codes whenever possible.

     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
             a terminal.

     -c      Use time when file status was last changed for sorting (-t) or
             long printing (-l).

     -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively).

     -e      Print the Access Control List (ACL) associated with the file, if
             present, in long (-l) output.

     -F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a
             directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at
             sign (`@') after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after
             each socket, a percent sign (`%') after each whiteout, and a ver-
             tical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.

     -f      Output is not sorted.  This option turns on the -a option.

     -G      Enable colorized output.  This option is equivalent to defining
             CLICOLOR in the environment.  (See below.)

     -g      This option is only available for compatibility with POSIX; it is
             used to display the group name in the long (-l) format output
             (the owner name is suppressed).

     -H      Symbolic links on the command line are followed.  This option is
             assumed if none of the -F, -d, or -l options are specified.

     -h      When used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte,
             Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the
             number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.

     -i      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode num-
             ber).

     -k      If the -s option is specified, print the file size allocation in
             kilobytes, not blocks.  This option overrides the environment
             variable BLOCKSIZE.

     -L      Follow all symbolic links to final target and list the file or
             directory the link references rather than the link itself.  This
             option cancels the -P option.

     -l      (The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See
             below.)  If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the
             file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.

     -m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by
             commas.

     -n      Display user and group IDs numerically, rather than converting to
             a user or group name in a long (-l) output.  This option turns on
             the -l option.

     -O      Include the file flags in a long (-l) output.

     -o      List in long format, but omit the group id.

     -P      If argument is a symbolic link, list the link itself rather than
             the object the link references.  This option cancels the -H and
             -L options.

     -p      Write a slash (`/') after each filename if that file is a direc-
             tory.

     -q      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the
             character `?'; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     -r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical
             order or the oldest entries first (or largest files last, if com-
             bined with sort by size

     -S      Sort files by size

     -s      Display the number of file system blocks actually used by each
             file, in units of 512 bytes, where partial units are rounded up
             to the next integer value.  If the output is to a terminal, a
             total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the
             listing.  The environment variable BLOCKSIZE overrides the unit
             size of 512 bytes.

     -T      When used with the -l (lowercase letter ``ell'') option, display
             complete time information for the file, including month, day,
             hour, minute, second, and year.

     -t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sort-
             ing the operands by lexicographical order.

     -u      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file
             for sorting (-t) or long printing (-l).

     -U      Use time of file creation, instead of last modification for sort-
             ing (-t) or long output (-l).

     -v      Force unedited printing of non-graphic characters; this is the
             default when output is not to a terminal.

     -W      Display whiteouts when scanning directories.  (-S) flag).

     -w      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the
             default when output is not to a terminal.

     -x      The same as -C, except that the multi-column output is produced
             with entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns.

     The -1, -C, -x, and -l options all override each other; the last one
     specified determines the format used.

     The -c and -u options override each other; the last one specified deter-
     mines the file time used.

     The -B, -b, -w, and -q options all override each other; the last one
     specified determines the format used for non-printable characters.

     The -H, -L and -P options all override each other (either partially or
     fully); they are applied in the order specified.

     By default, ls lists one entry per line to standard output; the excep-
     tions are to terminals or when the -C or -x options are specified.

     File information is displayed with one or more <blank>s separating the
     information associated with the -i, -s, and -l options.

   The Long Format
     If the -l option is given, the following information is displayed for
     each file: file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of
     bytes in the file, abbreviated month, day-of-month file was last modi-
     fied, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the path-
     name.  In addition, for each directory whose contents are displayed, the
     total number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the directory is
     displayed on a line by itself, immediately before the information for the
     files in the directory.  If the file or directory has extended
     attributes, the permissions field printed by the -l option is followed by
     a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended secu-
     rity information (such as an access control list), the permissions field
     printed by the -l option is followed by a '+' character.

     If the modification time of the file is more than 6 months in the past or
     future, then the year of the last modification is displayed in place of
     the hour and minute fields.

     If the owner or group names are not a known user or group name, or the -n
     option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed.

     If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and
     minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field.  If
     the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to file is pre-
     ceded by ``->''.

     The file mode printed under the -l option consists of the entry type,
     owner permissions, and group permissions.  The entry type character
     describes the type of file, as follows:

           b     Block special file.
           c     Character special file.
           d     Directory.
           l     Symbolic link.
           s     Socket link.
           p     FIFO.
           -     Regular file.

     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group
     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character posi-
     tions:

           1.   If r, the file is readable; if -, it is not readable.

           2.   If w, the file is writable; if -, it is not writable.

           3.   The first of the following that applies:

                      S     If in the owner permissions, the file is not exe-
                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is not executable and
                            set-group-ID mode is set.

                      s     If in the owner permissions, the file is exe-
                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is executable and set-
                            group-ID mode is set.

                      x     The file is executable or the directory is search-
                            able.

                      -     The file is neither readable, writable, exe-
                            cutable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode,
                            nor sticky.  (See below.)

                These next two apply only to the third character in the last
                group (other permissions).

                      T     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute
                            or search permission.  (See chmod(1) or
                            sticky(8).)

                      t     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is search-
                            able or executable.  (See chmod(1) or sticky(8).)

EXAMPLES
     The following is how to do an ls listing sorted by increasing size

           ls -lrS

DIAGNOSTICS
     The ls utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of ls:

     BLOCKSIZE       If the environment variable BLOCKSIZE is set, the block
                     counts (see -s) will be displayed in units of that size
                     block.

     CLICOLOR        Use ANSI color sequences to distinguish file types.  See
                     LSCOLORS below.  In addition to the file types mentioned
                     in the -F option some extra attributes (setuid bit set,
                     etc.) are also displayed.  The colorization is dependent
                     on a terminal type with the proper termcap(5) capabili-
                     ties.  The default ``cons25'' console has the proper
                     capabilities, but to display the colors in an xterm(1),
                     for example, the TERM variable must be set to
                     ``xterm-color''.  Other terminal types may require simi-
                     lar adjustments.  Colorization is silently disabled if
                     the output isn't directed to a terminal unless the
                     CLICOLOR_FORCE variable is defined.

     CLICOLOR_FORCE  Color sequences are normally disabled if the output isn't
                     directed to a terminal.  This can be overridden by set-
                     ting this flag.  The TERM variable still needs to refer-
                     ence a color capable terminal however otherwise it is not
                     possible to determine which color sequences to use.

     COLUMNS         If this variable contains a string representing a decimal
                     integer, it is used as the column position width for dis-
                     playing multiple-text-column output.  The ls utility cal-
                     culates how many pathname text columns to display based
                     on the width provided.  (See -C and -x.)

     LANG            The locale to use when determining the order of day and
                     month in the long -l format output.  See environ(7) for
                     more information.

     LSCOLORS        The value of this variable describes what color to use
                     for which attribute when colors are enabled with
                     CLICOLOR.  This string is a concatenation of pairs of the
                     format fb, where f is the foreground color and b is the
                     background color.

                     The color designators are as follows:

                           a     black
                           b     red
                           c     green
                           d     brown
                           e     blue
                           f     magenta
                           g     cyan
                           h     light grey
                           A     bold black, usually shows up as dark grey
                           B     bold red
                           C     bold green
                           D     bold brown, usually shows up as yellow
                           E     bold blue
                           F     bold magenta
                           G     bold cyan
                           H     bold light grey; looks like bright white
                           x     default foreground or background

                     Note that the above are standard ANSI colors.  The actual
                     display may differ depending on the color capabilities of
                     the terminal in use.

                     The order of the attributes are as follows:

                           1.   directory
                           2.   symbolic link
                           3.   socket
                           4.   pipe
                           5.   executable
                           6.   block special
                           7.   character special
                           8.   executable with setuid bit set
                           9.   executable with setgid bit set
                           10.  directory writable to others, with sticky bit
                           11.  directory writable to others, without sticky
                                bit

                     The default is "exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad", i.e. blue fore-
                     ground and default background for regular directories,
                     black foreground and red background for setuid executa-
                     bles, etc.

     LS_COLWIDTHS    If this variable is set, it is considered to be a colon-
                     delimited list of minimum column widths.  Unreasonable
                     and insufficient widths are ignored (thus zero signifies
                     a dynamically sized column).  Not all columns have
                     changeable widths.  The fields are, in order: inode,
                     block count, number of links, user name, group name,
                     flags, file size, file name.

     TERM            The CLICOLOR functionality depends on a terminal type
                     with color capabilities.

     TZ              The timezone to use when displaying dates.  See
                     environ(7) for more information.

COMPATIBILITY
     The group field is now automatically included in the long listing for
     files in order to be compatible with the IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'')
     specification.

LEGACY DESCRIPTION
     In legacy mode, the -f option does not turn on the -a option and the -g,
     -n, and -o options do not turn on the -l option.

     Also, the -o option causes the file flags to be included in a long (-l)
     output; there is no -O option.

     When -H is specified (and not overridden by -L or -P) and a file argument
     is a symlink that resolves to a non-directory file, the output will
     reflect the nature of the link, rather than that of the file.  In legacy
     operation, the output will describe the file.

     For more information about legacy mode, see compat(5).

STANDARDS
     The ls utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').

HISTORY
     An ls command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

BUGS
     To maintain backward compatibility, the relationships between the many
     options are quite complex.

### Summary

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the command `pwd` to find out where you are in on your computer
- use the command `ls` to list directory contents
- use flags `-l` and `-lh` to guide the output of the `ls` command
- use the command `cd` to move around your computer
- use the `man` command to check the manual page

## Basics

As well as navigating directories, you can interact with files on the command line: 
you can read them, open them, run them, and even edit them, often without ever 
having to leave the interface. Sometimes it is easier to do this using a 
Graphical User Interface, such as Word or your normal explorer,
but the more you work here, the more it is useful, and the more you write scripts, the more you'll need this basic knowledge.

Here's a few basic ways to interact with files. 

First, you can create a new directory. For convenience's sake, we will create it in the directory you extracted the 
data provided in advance. 

~~~
pwd
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~

~~~
/Users/riley
~~~
{: .output}


Now type `mkdir firstdir` and hit enter. This used the `mkdir` command (meaning 'make directories') to create a directory named 'firstdir'. Then move into that directory using the `cd` command.

~~~
mkdir firstdir
cd firstdir
~~~
{: .bash}

But wait! There's a trick to make things a bit quicker. Go up one directory (`cd ..`). 
To navigate to the `firstdir` directory you could type `cd firstdir`. 
Alternatively, you could type `cd f` and then hit tab
You will notice that the interface completes the line to `cd firstdir`. 

> ## Tab for Auto-complete
>Hitting tab at any time within the shell will prompt it to attempt to auto-complete
>the line based on the files or sub-directories in the current directory. 
>Where two or more files have the same characters, the auto-complete will only fill up to the 
>first point of difference, after which you can add more characters, and 
>try using tab again. We would encourage using this method throughout 
>today to see how it behaves (as it saves loads of time and effort!).
{: .callout}

The next step is to manipulate files.

Navigate to the `shell-data` directory in the pre-circulated data directory. 

~~~
cd shell-data
~~~
{: .bash}

In here there is a copy of Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels* downloaded from 
Project Gutenberg. type `ls -lh` and hit enter to see details of this file.

~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
{: .output}


You can read the text right here. To try this, type `cat 829-0.txt`. 

~~~
cat 820-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}


The terminal window erupts and *Gulliver's Travels* cascades by: this is what is known as printing to the shell. 
And it is great, in theory, but you can't really make any sense of that amount of text. 
Instead, you may want to just look at the first or the last bit of the file. 

>Canceling Commands
>To cancel this print of `829-0.txt`, or indeed any ongoing in the Unix shell, hit `ctrl+c`**
{: .bash}

Type `head 829-0.txt` and hit enter.

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

~~~
{: .output}


This provides a view of the first ten lines,
whereas `tail 829-0.txt` provides a perspective on the last ten lines. 
This is a good way to quickly determine the contents of the file.

~~~
tail 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
TODO output
~~~
{: .output}


Another way to navigate files is to view the contents one screen at a time. 
Type `less 829-0.txt` to see the first screen, `spacebar` to see the 
next screen and so on, then `q` to quit (return to the command prompt).

~~~
less 829-0.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

You may also want to change the file name to something more descriptive. 
You can **move** it to a new name by using the `mv` or move command. 
To do this type `mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt` and hit enter. This is equivalent to the 'rename file' function.

~~~
mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Afterwards, when you perform a `ls` command, you will see that it is now `gulliver.txt`.

~~~
ls 
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv    2014-02-01_JA-art .tsv      gulliver.txt
2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv   2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv
2014-01_JA.tsv.zip      gallic.txt
~~~
{: .output}


Had you wanted to duplicate it, you could have used the `cp` or copy command by typing `cp 829-0.txt gulliver.txt`
That would have created a a new file with the title `gulliver.txt` while leaving the original file `829-0.txt` intact.

~~~
cp 829-0.txt gulliver.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Now that you have seen and used several new commands, it's time for another trick. 
Hit the up arrow twice on your keyboard. Notice that `mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt` 
appears before your cursor. You can continue pressing the up arrow to cycle 
through your previous commands. The down arrow cycles back toward your most recent command. 
This is another important labour-saving function and something we'll use a lot.

{: .challenge}

Good, now that you have two copies of *Gulliver's Travels*, 
let's put them together to make an **even longer** book. 

To combine, or concatenate, two or more files use the `cat` command 
again. 

~~~
cat gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

This prints, or displays, the combined files within the shell. 
However, it is too long to read on this window! 
Luckily, by using the `>` redirector, you can send the output to 
a new file, rather than the terminal window. 

Hit up arrow to get to your last command and amend the line to: 

~~~
cat gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt > gulliver-twice.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

and hit enter. Now, when you type `ls` you'll see `gulliver-twice.txt` appear in your directory.

~~~
ls
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
2014-01-31_JA-africa.tsv    2014-02-01_JA-art .tsv      gulliver-backup.txt
2014-01-31_JA-america.tsv   2014-02-02_JA-britain.tsv   gulliver-twice.txt
2014-01_JA.tsv.zip      gallic.txt          gulliver.txt
~~~
{: .output}

When combining more than two files, using a wildcard can 
help avoid having to write out each filename individually. 
Again, labour saving! A useful wildcard is `*` which is a place holder for zero or 
more characters or numbers (note: this is slightly different from regex...). 
So, if you type:

~~~
cat *.txt > everything-together.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

and hit enter, a combination of all the `.txt` files in the current directory 
are combined in alphabetical order as `everything-together.txt`. 
This can be very useful if you need to combine a large number of 
smaller files within a directory so that you can work with them in 
a text analysis program. 

Another wildcard worth remembering is `?` which is a place holder 
for a single character or number. We shall return to shell wildcards later - for 
now, note again that they are similar to but not excatly the same as the Regex we saw in the previous module.

Finally, onto deleting. We won't use it now, but if you do want to delete a file, 
for whatever reason, the command is `rm`, or remove. 

**Be careful with the `rm` command**, as you don't want to delete files that you do not mean to. 
Unlike deleting from within your Graphical User Interface, there is **no** recycling bin 
or undo options. For that reason, if you are in doubt, you may want to exercise caution 
or maintain a regular backup of your data.

The syntax for `rm` is the same as `cp` and `mv`: 
for example:  

~~~
rm gulliver.txt
~~~
{: .bash}
 
adding wildcards as appropriate to specify the files to delete.

## Summary

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the command `mv` to rename and move files.
- use the command `cp` to create a file from an existing file.
- use the command `cat` to combine more than one file of the same file type.
- use the wildcards `*` and `?` as place holders that delimit which files are to be manipulated by a given an action.
- use the `rm` command to delete unwanted files.
